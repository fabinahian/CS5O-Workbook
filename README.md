# Welcome to My CS50 Repository!

Welcome to my CS50 repository! Here, you'll find a collection of programming exercises completed as part of the CS50 course. As I progress through the course material, this repository will serve as a central hub for storing my solutions to various problem sets, assignments, and challenges.

## Organization

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different week or module in the CS50 curriculum. Within each folder, you'll discover my solutions to the programming exercises for that particular week. I've carefully organized everything to ensure easy navigation, so you should have no trouble finding what you need.

## Course Sources

To access the CS50 course material, please visit the following sources:

1. [CS50 2023 Course](https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/)

## Join the Journey

I created this repository not only for my own benefit but also for other CS50 students who may encounter similar challenges along the way. Whether you're looking for inspiration, guidance, or just want to see how others tackled the same problems, you're in the right place!

## Let's Collaborate

I invite you to explore my code, leave comments, and even share your own solutions if you'd like. Let's foster a collaborative learning environment where we can all grow and succeed together. After all, learning is a journey best enjoyed in good company!

Happy coding, and let's dive into the exciting world of CS50 together! ðŸš€
