    Author's Thoughts

Welcome to my CS50 repository! This is where I'll be organizing all the programming exercises I complete as part of the CS50 course. As I work through the course material, I'll be using this repository to store my solutions to various problem sets, assignments, and challenges.

Each folder in this repository corresponds to a different week or module in the CS50 curriculum. Within each folder, you'll find my solutions to the programming exercises for that week. I've tried to keep things organized and easy to navigate, so you should be able to find what you're looking for without too much trouble.

I'm hoping that this repository will serve as a helpful resource not just for myself, but for other CS50 students who might be struggling with the same exercises. Please feel free to browse through my code, leave comments, and share your own solutions as well. Let's learn together!
